=begin
blueprints or templates for creating objects
builtin arrays and hashes cannot represent everything
what if we need to represent something in real life
    like users
    cars
    invoices
goral is to use code to model real life things as classes.
An Object is a custom container for data. it is made from a class
Objects group functionalities into a single unit

# Object Attributes and Methods
    #Instance variable (attributes) are variables that belong to the object
    #Attributes provide information about the object's current state
        # attributes are details about the object
    #Instance Methods interact with the object. they also belong to the object
    #Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object

#CLASSES AND OBJECTS
    #a CLASS is the blueprint, pattern, template, or outline for and object
    #an OBJECT is an instance of the class it is created from the class.
    #INSTANTIATION is the process of creating an object from a class
=begin
A class is called an ABSTRACT TYPE because it hides the 
complexity of interacting with the data, much like a method
abstracts the complexity of a process
